# Machine_Learning_Project
The goal of the project is to create a neural network that can detect and localize cars in images.  
Problem:  The goal is to be able to detect the location of a car, in a frame, in a live video feed.  The code was developed to supplelent a project where a bicyle rider could be alerted if a car is approcahing from the rear.  In order to determine if a car is getting closer, the number of pixels that the car 'occupies' can be used to determine the distance with respect to the rider.
